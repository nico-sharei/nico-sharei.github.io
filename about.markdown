I’m a graduate of the Master’s in Data Science program at the University of Mannheim. I wrote my master’s thesis in collaboration with Porsche AG, focusing on large language models 🏎️

Prior to that, I spent three years working as a Data Science student at SAP AG, where I had the opportunity to learn and grow within an all-around amazing team.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing volleyball 🏐 and soccer ⚽️, running 🏃, and traveling 🧳.
