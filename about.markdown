I am a graduate of the Masters in Data Science Programme at the University of Mannheim and wrote my masters thesis with the Porsche AG in the field of LLMs 🏎️

Prior to that I also worked three years for the SAP AG as a Data Science student.  

Outside of work I enjoy playing volleyball 🏐, soccer ⚽️, running 🏃 and travelling 🧳
