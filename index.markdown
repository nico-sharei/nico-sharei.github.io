Hi! Welcome to my personal page 👋

I’m a Master’s graduate in Data Science based in Germany 🇩🇪 with a strong interest in Machine Learning and research.

My long-term goal is to become a researcher in machine learning and actively contribute to advancing the field.
To grow in this area, I frequently work on small projects and experiments. This website essentially serves as a space to document them, along with my thoughts, ideas, and reflections as I learn.


Feel free to explore. maybe you’ll find something interesting 😌
