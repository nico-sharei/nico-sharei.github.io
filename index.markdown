Hi! Welcome to my personal page 👋

I’m a Master’s graduate in Data Science based in Stuttgart, with a strong interest in Machine Learning.

My goal is to become an applied research scientist and actively contribute to advancing the field. I do a bunch of small projects and experiments to keep learning, and this page is where I document them along with my thoughts and reflections.

Feel free to explore. Maybe you’ll find something interesting 😌
