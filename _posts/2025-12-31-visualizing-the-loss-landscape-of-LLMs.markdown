Recently I came across the paper [Visualizing the Loss Landscape of Neural Nets][visualizing-paper] paper by Li et al. (2018), which proposed an approach to well - visualize the loss landscape of Deep Learning architectures. It is widely accepted as the baseline approach for this purpose. 

In this approach,
